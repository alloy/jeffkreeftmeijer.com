"Navvy":http://github.com/jeffkreeftmeijer/navvy is an ORM agnostic Ruby background job processor I released in January, initially with database adapters for ActiveRecord and MongoMapper.

It didn't take long before "Ruby5":http://ruby5.envylabs.com/episodes/45-episode-43-january-19-2010/stories/350-navvy-database-agnostic-background-jobs and "the Changelog":http://thechangelog.com/post/356754061/navvy-simple-database-agnostic-ruby-background-job-proce picked it up, people started using it, "@antekpiechnik":http://twitter.com/antekpiechnik wrote adapters for Sequel and Datamapper and I got a lot of help from some more "contributors":http://wiki.github.com/jeffkreeftmeijer/navvy/contributors.

But after a while I started having problems keeping all four adapters up to date and I found that the project was growing unnecessarily big. So I decided to rip out the adapters and put them in separate gems. That way I could maintain the MongoMapper adapter and let the rest be maintained by others. Also, the Navvy base hadn't got the attention it deserved for a while, so there were some overdue cleanups to be done there too.
