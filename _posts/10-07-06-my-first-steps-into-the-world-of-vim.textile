I’ve been using Textmate since I switched to the Mac. It worked properly and I was fine with it. I never looked into "Vim":http://www.vim.org until a few months after "@antekpiechinik":http://twitter.com/antekpiechnik told me I should.

To be honest, I thought Vim was for people that felt too cool to go out of the terminal and that it didn’t really add anything other than “I’m in the terminal”-awesomeness. Needless to say, I was wrong.

After I got excited by this &ldquo;["Welcome to Vim":http://vimeo.com/6999927]&rdquo;-video, I dove into the @vim tutor@ to learn about normal, edit and visual mode, jumping though files, deleting, adding copying and editing stuff, running terminal commands from my text editor and stuff like that.

After finishing that, I felt quite confident about myself. Until I tried to edit an actual Ruby file and I realized I forgot half of what I'd learned.

Although I'm still struggling, it seems obvious to me that Vim adds a lot of speed in comparison to Textmate when you get used to it.

h3. Customizing Vim

I’ve never really taken the time to customize Textmate, except for installing the "Railscasts theme":http://railscasts.com/about, and the "Ruby":http://github.com/drnic/ruby-tmbundle and "Rails":http://github.com/drnic/ruby-on-rails-tmbundle bundles. That was all I needed. No RSpec or Git bundles, I prefered to run specs and push to my repository in the terminal. Heck, I never even used Textmate’s snippets and forgot to use CMD+T to open files all the time.

After using Vim for a while, I realized I was missing some things. So I installed the "Railscasts Vim colorscheme":http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2175 and "NERDTree":http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1658 as a substitute for Textmate's project drawer. Awesome plugin, but since I got tired of typing @:NERDTreeToggle@ to open and close it I mapped it to my F2 key. Super fast.

Vim has no line numbers by default, which creeped me out. Putting @set number@ in my @./~vimrc@ file did the trick. I searched around and stole some settings from other people too. Man, this thing is customizable.

Oh, I’ve put everything in my "dotfiles repository on Github":http://github.com/jeffkreeftmeijer/dotfiles. In case you need it.

As I said, I still have a lot to learn but I think I'll stick to Vim for at least a while. So, keep an eye on this space for more vim stuff in the future and if you have some tips: be sure to let me know!
