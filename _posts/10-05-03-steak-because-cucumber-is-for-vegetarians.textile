I'm not going to tell you "why you should write acceptance (or integration) tests":http://robots.thoughtbot.com/post/543043259/unit-and-functional-tests-are-as-useful-as-100-code, but you should. I used "Cucumber":http://cukes.info/ for a while now and I love it, but I think writing my tests in a &ldquo;"business-readable domain-specific language":http://www.martinfowler.com/bliki/BusinessReadableDSL.html&rdquo; and translating them into Ruby using step definitions is a bit too much sometimes. And I'm not a vegetarian.

Luckily, we have "Steak":http://github.com/cavalle/steak by "@cavalle(Luismi Cavallé)":http://twitter.com/cavalle:

<img src="/images/steak.jpg"/>

bq. &ldquo;Steak is like Cucumber but in plain Ruby. No explicit givens, whens or thens. No steps, no english, just Ruby: RSpec and Steak. That’s all.&rdquo;

Right now the stable version of Steak only works with Rails 2.x and "RSpec":http://rspec.info/ 1.x, but there's a "Rails 3 branch":http://github.com/cavalle/steak/tree/rails3 where some work is being done to support Rails 3.x and RSpec 2.x. I've been using that one, but this article should also be fine for you when you're on Rails 2.x.

h3. Installation

Ok, throw this into your @Gemfile@ (I'm specifying the @0.4.0.a3@ version for Steak, that's the most recent alpha release from the rails3 branch). Also, I'll be using "Webrat":http://github.com/brynary/webrat to keep it simple (Steak only generates files for Webrat):

bc. gem 'steak', '0.4.0.a3'
gem 'webrat'

And install your bundle:

bc. $ bundle install

Or — if you’re using Rails 2.x — put this in @config/environment.rb@:

bc. config.gem 'steak'
config.gem 'webrat'

And run:

bc. $ rake gems:install RAILS_ENV=test

Now you can use the Steak generators. To set everything up, just run:

bc. $ rails generate steak

Please remember to use @script/generate@ instead of @rails generate@ when on Rails 2.x.

The generator created the @spec/acceptance@ directory in your project, in which you can find @acceptance_helper.rb@ and the @support@ directory. The @support@ directory holds @paths.rb@ -- which should be familiar if you've used Cucumber before -- and @helpers.rb@.

h3. Acceptance specs

Now, let's write our first acceptance spec -- no, we're not calling it a &ldquo;feature&rdquo;. It's a spec. -- by using another generator (I'm creating an articles spec here):

bc. $ rails generate acceptance_spec articles

Steak generated @spec/acceptance/articles_spec.rb@, which looks like this:

<pre><code>require File.dirname(__FILE__) + '/acceptance_helper'

feature "Feature name", %q{
  In order to ...
  As a ...
  I want to ...
} do
  
  scenario "Scenario name" do
    true.should == true
  end
  
end</code></pre>

If you're a Cucumber user, the feature description should look familiar. I'll try to describe what I'm doing like this:

bc. feature "Articles", %q{
  In order to have an awesome blog
  As an author
  I want to create and manage articles
} do

Great. On to our first scenario. In the articles index we want to show all articles in a list.

<pre><code>scenario "Article index" do
  Article.create!(:title => 'One')
  Article.create!(:title => 'Two')
  visit '/articles'
  response.should contain('One')
  response.should contain('Two')
end
</code></pre>

First, I create two articles called &ldquo;One&rdquo; and &ldquo;Two&rdquo; (please, use a tool like "Machinist":http://github.com/notahat/machinist for that). Then I visit the articles index and check if the article titles show up. Really simple.

h3. Minimalist acceptance testing

Steak just provides some aliases (like @scenario@ and @feature@) for RSpec's methods &ldquo;providing you with the language of acceptance testing&rdquo;. Here's a snippet from  "Steak's library":http://github.com/cavalle/steak/blob/master/lib/steak.rb:

<pre><code>module Spec::Example::ExampleGroupMethods
  alias scenario example
  alias background before
end

module Spec::DSL::Main
  alias feature describe
end</code></pre>

So, if you know your RSpec, the only thing you'll have to do is dive into "Webrat":http://github.com/brynary/webrat (or "Capybara":http://github.com/jnicklas/capybara) for a bit and you'll be writing acceptance specs in no time.

h3. Running your spec

You might have guessed, but running your acceptance specs is exactly the same as running any other spec. After all, it's just a minimal layer on top of RSpec:

bc. $ spec spec/acceptance/articles_spec.rb

h3. Cucumber vs Steak?

Cucumber is highly focussed on creating a business-readable DSL, and does so perfectly. I understand the thought behind making stakeholders able to read what's going on in their projects, but I wonder how many people actually do this. Also, one might argue that -- from a Ruby programmer's perspective -- Steak's specs are in fact more readable than Cucumber's.

Steak takes away the extra step of translating everything from English to Ruby and is incredibly easy to learn (especially when you have some RSpec experience). It's completely incomparable to Cucumber though and which one to choose is simply a matter of opinion.

I think I'll have mine medium rare.
